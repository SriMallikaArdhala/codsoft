Below is a concise description of each Java program (Number Guessing Game, Grade Calculator, and Currency Converter) that I developed as part of my CodSoft internship.  

### 1. Number Guessing Game
**Overview**: A Java-based console application where the player guesses a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, with a limited number of attempts.

**Key Points**:
- Generates a random number within a user-defined range (e.g., 1 to 100).
- Prompts the user to input guesses and validates input for correctness.
- Provides hints ("too high" or "too low") to guide the player.
- Tracks the number of attempts and ends the game when attempts are exhausted or the correct number is guessed.
- Includes a replay option to start a new game.

### 2. Grade Calculator
**Overview**: A Java program that calculates a student's average marks based on input scores for multiple subjects and assigns a grade according to predefined criteria.

**Key Points**:
- Accepts marks for a specified number of subjects via user input.
- Validates input to ensure marks are within a valid range (0â€“100).
- Calculates the average marks and determines the corresponding grade (e.g., A, B, C).
- Displays total marks, average, and final grade in a clear format.
- Handles edge cases, such as invalid inputs, with appropriate error messages.

### 3. Currency Converter
**Overview**: A Java application that converts an amount from one currency to another using predefined exchange rates, allowing users to select source and target currencies.

**Key Points**:
- Supports conversion between multiple currencies (e.g., USD, EUR, INR) using fixed exchange rates.
- Prompts the user to input the amount and select source/target currencies.
- Performs accurate conversion calculations based on the exchange rate.
- Displays the converted amount with proper formatting (e.g., currency symbols).
- Includes input validation to handle invalid amounts or currency selections.
